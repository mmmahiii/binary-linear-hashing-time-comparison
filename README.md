# binary-linear-hashing-time-comparison
This code is used to compare the time complexity of linear and binary searches, along with a hash table retrieval search algorithm. 
The hash table uses pythons inbuilt hash() function.

The code searches using a worst case scenario (a value that isn't in the data structure), and also calculates the average timings over multiple runs (numOfRuns = 1000). This allows for the result to be more coherent with the respective bigO time complexities.

Bare in mind that the execution of the search functions relies heavily on the resource allocation of your computer. If you have many background processes or varying runtime environments then the graph that is plotted may look different to whats expected.
